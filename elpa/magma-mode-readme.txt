Basic setup:

Ensure that the installation directory is in your `load-path' (it
is done for you if installing from melpa), and add the following
line to your emacs init file:

    (require 'magma-mode)

Additionally, if you want to load the mode automatically with some
file extensions, you can add the following to your init file:

    (setq auto-mode-alist
    (append '(("\\.mgm$\\|\\.m$" . magma-mode))
            auto-mode-alist))

Some features are available in `magma-extra.el'. They are disabled
because they are more intrusive than the others. Feel free to
browse the customize interface to enable some of them!

Some support for `hs-minor-mode', `imenu' and `smart-parens' is
also provided.

If you are using `yasnippet', you can enable some snippets for
`magma-mode' by adding the following to your init file.

    (require 'magma-snippets)

At the moment, these snippets include basic syntactic constructs
(if, while, for, etc.) and load (with file name completion). More
will be added in the future.
