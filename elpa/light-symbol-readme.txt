;;; Commentary:

;; This defines a new minor mode which highlights the symbol under
;; point in the current buffer.  You must pause briefly in order to
;; see the effect.  The highlight is removed when you take any action.

;; ToDo:

;; - should use defcustom
;; - don't do anything when in string syntax - ?
;;   also perhaps not in comment syntax?
